  <h2 style="color: #0f3c68;">1. Introduction: Who is Virat Kohli?</h2>
  <p>Virat Kohli is one of the greatest cricketers the world has ever seen ‚Äî a modern-day legend who changed the face of Indian cricket with his aggressive attitude, unmatched consistency, and sharp focus on fitness. With over a decade of excellence in international cricket, Kohli has become more than just a cricketer ‚Äî he's a symbol of modern India's spirit: passionate, driven, and never ready to give up. From his fiery innings to emotional speeches, Kohli's journey is a perfect example of how raw talent, discipline, and self-belief can create greatness.</p> <br>

  <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">2. Early Life and Childhood</h3>
  <p>Virat Kohli was born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father Prem Kohli was a criminal lawyer, and his mother Saroj Kohli was a homemaker. He had two siblings ‚Äî elder brother Vikas and sister Bhawna. Even as a toddler, Virat showed unusual interest in cricket. At the age of just 3, he picked up a bat and started swinging it with a natural style. Recognizing his passion, his family supported him wholeheartedly.<p><br>
  <p>He was enrolled in the West Delhi Cricket Academy at the age of 9, where he trained under coach Rajkumar Sharma. Virat‚Äôs dedication stood out from the beginning ‚Äî he would be the first to reach the ground and the last to leave, often staying back after practice. His childhood wasn‚Äôt luxurious, but it was full of love, ambition, and the determination to rise through the ranks.</p><br>

  <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">3. Education and Cricket Together</h3>
  <p>Kohli studied at Vishal Bharti Public School, where his teachers remember him as a bright student who was always focused on cricket. Later, he shifted to Saviour Convent School to get a better balance between academics and sports. Unlike many students who stop focusing on studies due to sports or vice versa, Virat tried to maintain both. However, cricket was always his first love.</p><br>

  <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">4. Early Cricket Journey and Tragedy</h3>
  <p>Virat began playing for Delhi in the Under-15 and Under-17 levels, where he quickly gained attention for his high scores and stylish shots. His performances made it clear that he was a star in the making. However, one of the most emotional and defining moments of his life came in 2006, when he was just 18 years old. While playing a Ranji Trophy match for Delhi, his father passed away due to a brain stroke.<p><br>
  <p>Even in the face of such deep personal loss, Virat decided to continue playing the match the next day, scoring 90 runs for his team. He didn‚Äôt inform his teammates until after the match. This moment revealed his mental strength and fierce commitment to the game. It was from that day, he says, that cricket became not just a game for him ‚Äî it became a responsibility, a way to honor his father‚Äôs dream.</p><br>

  <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">5. Becoming a Star ‚Äì U-19 World Cup Glory</h3>
  <p>In 2008, Virat Kohli was selected as the captain of India‚Äôs U-19 team for the ICC Under-19 World Cup held in Malaysia. Under his leadership, India won the tournament, and Virat led from the front both with the bat and his strong captaincy. His aggressive on-field attitude, fitness, and commitment caught everyone‚Äôs attention ‚Äî including Indian selectors.</p><br>

  <p> World Cup victory became his ticket to the Indian national team. Soon after, he was included in the senior squad for India‚Äôs tour of Sri Lanka in August 2008.<p><br>

  <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">6. International Debut and Rise in Team India</h3>
  <p>Virat made his One Day International (ODI) debut on August 18, 2008, against Sri Lanka. Though his performance was modest in the beginning, he showed glimpses of his talent.
