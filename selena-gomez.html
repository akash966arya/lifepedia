    <h2 style="color: #0f3c68;">1. Humble Beginnings in Texas</h2>
    <p>Selena Marie Gomez was born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas, to Ricardo Gomez and Mandy Teefey. Raised by her mother after her parents separated, Selena’s childhood was far from luxurious. Her mother, a former stage actress, worked multiple jobs to support them. Selena often speaks about growing up with limited means and how her early struggles shaped her appreciation for hard work and perseverance. Watching her mom work hard to make ends meet left a lasting impact on Selena, inspiring her to dream big despite the odds stacked against her.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">2. First Steps into the Spotlight</h3>
    <p>Selena’s career in entertainment began at a young age when she landed a role on the popular children’s show "Barney & Friends." Though it was a small start, it introduced her to the world of acting and performance. She was just seven years old, but already showed natural talent and charisma. Selena shared the screen with another future star, Demi Lovato, and both girls would go on to become pop culture icons. Her early exposure to television helped her build confidence and gave her the foundation she needed for bigger roles ahead.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">3. Disney Stardom with Wizards of Waverly Place</h3>
    <p>The major breakthrough came in 2007 when Selena was cast as Alex Russo in the Disney Channel series "Wizards of Waverly Place." The show was a massive hit and ran for four seasons, making Selena a household name among teens. Her witty performance and relatable character won millions of hearts around the world. During her Disney years, she not only acted but also began her music journey, recording songs for Disney soundtracks and developing her unique pop sound. It was the perfect platform that launched her into superstardom.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">4. Launching Her Music Career</h3>
    <p>Selena formed the band Selena Gomez & the Scene in 2009 and released multiple albums under Hollywood Records. Songs like “Naturally,” “Who Says,” and “Love You Like a Love Song” became instant hits, especially among teenagers. Her music blended upbeat pop with emotional lyrics, giving listeners something fun yet meaningful. After a few years, she transitioned into a solo career, releasing critically acclaimed albums like “Revival” and “Rare.” With each release, Selena’s sound matured, and so did her identity as a powerful woman in the music industry.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">5. Battling Health Struggles and Lupus</h3>
    <p>Behind the glitz and glam of fame, Selena faced a battle that many didn’t know about. She was diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease, in her early 20s. It severely affected her physical health and mental well-being. In 2017, she underwent a kidney transplant, with her best friend Francia Raisa donating the kidney that saved her life. This chapter revealed her strength and resilience to the world. Rather than hiding, she chose to speak openly about her illness, earning respect and admiration for her courage and transparency.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">6. Speaking Out on Mental Health</h3>
    <p>Selena has become a prominent voice in mental health awareness. She revealed that she suffers from anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder — topics that many celebrities shy away from. Through her Rare Beauty brand and her mental health initiative "Wondermind," she encourages people to embrace therapy, break stigma, and prioritize self-care. Her vulnerability and honesty have created a safe space for millions of fans who struggle silently. For Selena, sharing her truth is not just healing—it’s a responsibility she feels deeply.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">7. Expanding Her Acting Portfolio</h3>
    <p>Post-Disney, Selena took on more mature and diverse roles. She starred in films like “Spring Breakers,” “The Fundamentals of Caring,” and “A Rainy Day in New York,” proving her range as an actress. But her return to television with Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building” alongside Steve Martin and Martin Short has been a game-changer. The show received critical acclaim, and Selena's performance added humor, depth, and heart to the series. It marked a new chapter in her acting career—one that audiences and critics embraced.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">8. Entrepreneurship with Rare Beauty</h3>
    <p>In 2020, Selena launched her own makeup line, Rare Beauty, not just as a beauty brand but as a platform to promote mental health and self-acceptance. Her mission was to redefine beauty standards and help people feel good about themselves. The brand quickly became a commercial and cultural success, praised for its inclusive shade ranges, lightweight products, and emotional messaging. Rare Beauty isn’t just makeup—it’s a movement, and Selena stands proudly at its heart.</p><br>
