    <h2 style="color: #0f3c68;">1. Early Life and Family Background</h2>
    <p>Greta Thunberg was born on January 3, 2003, in Stockholm, Sweden. Her mother, Malena Ernman, is a famous opera singer, while her father, Svante Thunberg, is an actor. She also descends from a line of scientists—her grandfather was a well-known actor and her great-grandfather, Svante Arrhenius, was a Nobel Prize-winning chemist. Greta grew up in a culturally rich but environmentally modest household, and although her early years were ordinary, her future would be anything but. From a young age, Greta began asking questions about the world around her—why the skies were polluted, why forests were disappearing, and why no one seemed alarmed.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">2. First Encounter with Climate Change</h3>
    <p>At the age of 8, Greta first learned about global warming in school. While other children moved on to their next lesson, Greta couldn’t let it go. The images of melting ice caps, rising oceans, and displaced animals haunted her. The idea that the earth was slowly dying while adults ignored it planted a deep sense of discomfort in her. This wasn’t just another subject—it became an emotional burden. She couldn’t understand why no one was doing anything, and that inner turmoil would eventually turn into a mission that changed her life and inspired millions.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">3. Personal Struggles and Diagnosis</h3>
    <p>Greta faced several personal battles during her childhood. She was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome, OCD, and selective mutism. These conditions affected her ability to interact socially, but they also gave her unique strengths—especially in focus, honesty, and clarity. Greta doesn’t view her diagnosis as a disability; she calls it her “superpower.” Her ability to zero in on important issues and think logically without being distracted by societal norms gave her the strength to speak up when others remained silent. Her conditions didn’t hold her back—they helped shape her into the leader she became.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">4. Turning Point: A Family Awakening</h3>
    <p>Greta’s distress over climate change deeply impacted her mental and physical health. At one point, she stopped eating, lost weight rapidly, and barely spoke. Her parents were alarmed and began to learn more about the issue to support her. Eventually, her mother gave up her international opera career to reduce their carbon footprint. The entire family shifted toward an eco-conscious lifestyle. This transformation gave Greta renewed hope—her activism started at home, proving that personal change is the first step toward global action. Her family became her strongest supporters, walking with her every step of the way.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">5. The First School Strike</h3>
    <p>On August 20, 2018, Greta began skipping school every Friday and protesting outside the Swedish Parliament. With a handmade sign that read “School Strike for Climate,” she sat alone, day after day, rain or shine. What seemed like a silent, solo act of defiance quickly drew attention from local media and curious passersby. Greta’s message was simple: if adults refused to act like climate change was an emergency, children would. That one sign, one girl, and one conviction became the seed of a global movement that would echo across continents.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">6. Fridays for Future</h3>
    <p>Inspired by Greta, students from around the world joined her call to action. The "Fridays for Future" movement was born. From Australia to Argentina, millions of students began striking from school to demand climate action. Greta’s consistent presence, unwavering message, and powerful words united youth across cultures. She had become a symbol of conscience in a distracted world. Her impact grew exponentially, and soon, she wasn’t just leading a strike—she was leading a global generation determined to fight for its future.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">7. UN Speech and “How Dare You” Moment</h3>
    <p>In September 2019, Greta delivered a fiery speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit. Her words—“How dare you”—resonated globally. She didn’t plead with world leaders; she challenged them. She accused them of stealing her dreams and childhood with their empty words. The speech was raw, angry, and necessary. It wasn’t just a speech—it was a wake-up call. The image of this young girl scolding presidents, prime ministers, and CEOs went viral, and suddenly the world couldn’t look away. Greta wasn’t asking for attention—she was demanding accountability.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">8. Sailing to New York</h3>
    <p>In keeping with her low-carbon lifestyle, Greta refused to fly to New York for the UN summit. Instead, she sailed across the Atlantic on a zero-emissions yacht. The journey took two weeks, and she faced storms and seasickness. But for Greta, the symbolism mattered. She wanted the world to see that action speaks louder than convenience. The voyage wasn’t just about reaching a destination—it was about setting an example. She was willing to endure hardship for the planet, a lesson that resonated far beyond environmental circles.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">9. Books, Documentaries, and Public Appearances</h3>
    <p>Greta published a collection of her speeches titled “No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference,” and she has been the subject of documentaries like “I Am Greta.” These platforms allow her message to reach millions, even those outside of protest zones. She’s not a celebrity, yet her influence rivals that of world leaders. What makes her different is that she doesn’t seek fame—she seeks change. Every book, film, or interview she participates in is chosen carefully, always focused on amplifying the climate crisis, never herself.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">10. Challenging World Leaders</h3>
    <p>Greta has directly confronted presidents, parliaments, and multinational organizations. She doesn’t hesitate to criticize inaction, regardless of status or politics. She’s faced backlash from world leaders and media outlets, but her resolve never wavers. Greta believes in speaking truth to power, even if she stands alone. Her fearlessness has earned her enemies—but it’s also what makes her a hero to millions. She’s not afraid of confrontation, because she knows the stakes are far higher than politics—they are planetary.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">11. Awards and Global Recognition</h3>
    <p>Greta has received numerous honors, including Time’s Person of the Year (2019), Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience Award, and multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations. Yet, she consistently redirects the spotlight to the issue—not herself. She refuses to be distracted by fame. To her, these awards are reminders that the world is watching, and she uses them as tools to demand more action. Her ability to remain grounded amidst global adoration is a testament to her character.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">12. Climate Justice and Equity</h3>
    <p>Greta emphasizes that climate change is not just an environmental issue—it’s a matter of justice. Poor and marginalized communities suffer the most from global warming, despite contributing the least. She speaks up for indigenous peoples, small island nations, and future generations. Her fight is not just for clean air—it’s for dignity, fairness, and human rights. Greta has made it clear: if we want a livable planet, we must ensure that solutions benefit everyone, not just the privileged few.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">13. Commitment to Veganism and Minimalism</h3>
    <p>Greta practices what she preaches. She follows a vegan diet, avoids fast fashion, rarely shops, and limits her energy consumption. Her lifestyle is a reflection of her values—low-impact, thoughtful, and sustainable. She understands that individual choices matter, especially when made collectively. By living consciously, she sends a powerful message: change doesn’t always require grand gestures—it often begins with small, consistent choices.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">14. The Power of Youth</h3>
    <p>Greta has proven that age is no barrier to impact. She has redefined youth activism and empowered millions of young people to rise, organize, and demand justice. Through social media, speeches, and protests, she’s ignited a generational shift. Young people no longer wait for permission—they act. And it was Greta who gave them the courage to do so. She’s not just a leader—she’s a spark that lit a fire.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">15. Facing Criticism with Grace</h3>
    <p>Greta has endured mockery, online abuse, and personal attacks from powerful figures. But she never stoops to retaliation. She responds with wit, silence, or more facts. Her ability to stay calm in the face of hate is remarkable. She doesn’t seek to be liked—she seeks to be heard. And in that calm defiance lies her greatest strength.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">16. Environmental Literacy</h3>
    <p>Greta educates herself constantly. She reads scientific reports, listens to researchers, and ensures her speeches are backed by data. She’s not a scientist, but she’s become one of the world’s most informed environmental communicators. Her message isn’t about blind protest—it’s about evidence, urgency, and integrity. Greta bridges the gap between science and society in a way that few ever have.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">17. Sisterhood and Support</h3>
    <p>Greta shares a close bond with her younger sister Beata, who also faces mental health challenges. Their relationship is grounded in mutual understanding, compassion, and love. Greta often credits her family’s support as key to her activism. Her journey is not solitary—it’s rooted in relationships that strengthen her. This emotional foundation makes her activism even more authentic and enduring.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">18. Speaking Truth to Power</h3>
    <p>Whether it's the Davos Forum, European Parliament, or the UN, Greta brings an uncomfortable truth: that leaders have failed, and time is running out. She never softens the blow or pretends things are okay. She forces institutions to confront their failures. Her words make people uncomfortable—and that’s the point. She holds a mirror to power and asks it to reflect deeply.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">19. Future Vision and Focus</h3>
    <p>Greta continues to strike, speak, and lead. She doesn’t know exactly what lies ahead, but she knows she’ll never stop fighting for the planet. Whether through activism, writing, or simply living mindfully, she is committed to the cause. Her focus remains clear: systemic change, immediate action, and global solidarity. Greta isn’t waiting for a savior—she’s becoming one, through determination, honesty, and action.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">20. A Legacy of Courage</h3>
    <p>Greta Thunberg’s legacy is not defined by her age but by her courage. She showed the world that one voice, no matter how small, can ripple across continents and force empires to listen. She turned anxiety into activism, solitude into strength, and frustration into fuel. Her life is a reminder that the greatest revolutions often begin with a single brave step—and that true leadership doesn’t shout, it stands firm and speaks the truth. Greta Thunberg is not just a climate activist—she is the conscience of our generation.</p><br>
