    <h2 style="color: #0f3c68;">1. Humble Beginnings in Rosario</h2>
    <p>Lionel Andr√©s Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. His father, Jorge Messi, worked in a steel factory, and his mother, Celia, was a part-time cleaner. Messi grew up in a tight-knit, modest household, where football was more than just a sport ‚Äî it was a way of life. From the age of 4, he was already kicking the ball with his brothers and cousins on the dusty streets of his neighborhood.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">2. Early Signs of Greatness</h3>
    <p>Messi joined his first club, Grandoli, at just 5 years old. His coach was his father. Even as a child, he had an unusual balance, close control, and vision. At age 8, he joined the youth team of Newell‚Äôs Old Boys, a local Rosario club. His small size didn‚Äôt stop him from dominating kids much older than him. His teammates used to call him ‚ÄúThe Flea‚Äù ‚Äî a nickname that stuck forever.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">3. The Growth Hormone Disorder</h3>
    <p>At the age of 10, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. His body stopped growing naturally, and the monthly injections were expensive. His family couldn‚Äôt afford the $1,000 per month treatment. Despite his incredible talent, no Argentine club agreed to pay for his medical expenses.

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">4. A Life-Changing Chance at Barcelona</h3>
    <p>In 2000, Messi‚Äôs family took a huge risk ‚Äî they flew to Spain for a trial with FC Barcelona. After just one training session, the coaches were stunned.
