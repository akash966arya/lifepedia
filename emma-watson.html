    <h2 style="color: #0f3c68;">1. A Childhood in Paris and Oxfordshire</h2>
    <p>Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson was born on April 15, 1990, in Paris, France. Her father, Chris, was a lawyer, and her mother, Jacinda, worked in the UK Parliament. After her parentsâ€™ separation when she was five, Emma moved with her mother and brother to Oxfordshire, England. She was a creative, curious child and excelled in school, showing early promise in performance and academics.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">2. Discovering Acting at School</h3>
    <p>Emma attended the Dragon School and later Headington School in Oxford. She participated in school plays and was noted for her natural talent and confidence on stage.

    <h3 style="color: #0f3c68;">3. Audition for the Magic Role</h3>
